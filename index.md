## Intro 

_skip if you don't want a summation of the past 5 years of my life_

I have excelled at Maths from a young age, but it wasn't until I was in University at the age of 20 that I realised I was specifically interested in coding and programming. More specifically, I was interested game development, but for a long time I thought that was an unattainable dream. However, after 5 years of working on my own projects and reaching the hurdles of apsects I struggle with, such as asset and UI design, I feel I have gained enough skills and would benefit from working in a team where I could exercise those skills in which I excel, practice those which I struggle with, and leave that which I am terrible at to the experts (after all, that's what working in a team is all about, but I'm always happy to gain new skills).

## Looking For

I am looking for full-time or contract work in all aspects of game development, design and programming.

For more information about me, see below in order of importance (in my humble opinion).

## Skills

- **Most relevant**: C#, Unity, Python, Git
- **Less relevant**: Matlab, SQL, HTML, Javascript, Java

- Sports (tennis, rugby, running, cycling, swimming)
- Learning / practicing conversational French
- Charitable Work (Â£1000 collected in city centres for Meningitis Research, marathon)

## Education

- 1st Class MMath Mathematics Degree with Honours - University of Nottingham
- 1st Class MSc Computer Science Degree with Honours - University of Nottingham

## Experience

- Working with Python and C# in the Unity Engine on my own Programming Projects (see table at top of page for examples)
- Working in 4 different software teams over 18 months to aid engine projects (as part of a Graduate Scheme, I wasn't bounced around)
- _(Currently, for 9 months)_ Developing scripts in Python for engine verification
-- The skills I've gained in working in a team during my 2+ years at Rolls Royce can't be understated and will certainly carry through to any future employment in the games development industry
